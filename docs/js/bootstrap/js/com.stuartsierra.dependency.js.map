A graph contains nodes,\n  which may be any type which supports Clojure's equality semantics.\n  Edges are represented as pairs of nodes. An edge between two nodes X\n  and Y indicates that X depends on Y or, conversely, that Y is a\n  dependent of X. A dependency graph may not have cycles.\"\n  []\n  (MapDependencyGraph. {} {}))\n\n(defn depends?\n  \"True if x is directly or transitively dependent on y.\"\n  [graph x y]\n  (contains?
